## Installation from source

The following commands will create a `dist` directory in the root of the project. Within the `dist` directory, a directory containing the unpacked extension for your chosen platform will be created along with a zip file that can be uploaded to your webstore of choice.

To build both Chromium and Firefox:

```npm run build```

To build only Chromium:

```npm run build-chrome```

```npm run build-firefox```

Once you have the unpacked extension, follow these steps to install:

### Chrome and other Chromium based browsers:

Enter `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.  
Enable 'Developer mode' using the switch (usually located in the top right corner of the browser window, but some browsers may vary).  
Click the 'Load unpacked' button.  
Select the `/dist/chrome` directory.  

### Firefox

Enter `about:debugging` in the address bar.  
Choose 'This Firefox' from the menu.  
Click the 'Load Temporary Add-on' button.  
Select the `manifest.json` file located in the `/dist/firefox` directory.  

*nb. Firefox will remove temporary add-ons when the browser is closed.*
